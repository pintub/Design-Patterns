- **Alias** 
    - `Be liberal in what you accept from others, Be conservative in what you return` . Don't think in terms of money,but think in terms of how to receive and return behavior (:winking:) 
    - `Tolerant reader`
- **How to Implement**
    - Accept all types of arguments (even Null) , looks like it is good to accept Null and doing Null check at the starting of a method. 
    - Java provide `Be conservative in what you return` in form of covariance in overriding .
